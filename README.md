## Getting Started
Hello,
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I used Next.JS here.
Here at first I setup my tailwind config as my color palate. Then I create some components and create home page. Now it's easy to implement
anything. I breakdown all component so that I call those again and again. 
I create a UtilKit where I store all of my reuseable functions. 
Also I create a components folder. Where I store my all of common components
I use local storage to store all data.
